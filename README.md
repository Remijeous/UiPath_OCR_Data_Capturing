Optical Character Recognition

What happens when the PDF file is a scanned image? How will UiPath read the text?
The answer is Optical Character Recognition (OCR) which converts text in image format to actual text. 
This robot loops through scanned PDFs, scrapes the text and exports it into a text file.
